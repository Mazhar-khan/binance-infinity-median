# Binance Infinity Median Service

A lightweight **Node.js + Express** service that streams real-time Binance trade data and calculates a continuous **Infinity Median** for selected trading pairs.

The **Infinity Median** represents the median price derived from **all received trade prices** for a given pair (not just a limited window).  
This makes it suitable for **real-time analytics, trading insights, and data-driven backends**.

- Uses official Binance WebSocket stream:  
  `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream`

- Built with efficiency in mind: median calculation runs in **O(log n)** time.
- Ideal for real-time financial systems, trading dashboards, or backtesting tools.
